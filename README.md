# üéÆ Steam Dupe Finder Plugin

Automatically identifies games in your vault that are also available in your Steam library and logs them for review.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

1. **Download & Extract:** Get the [latest release](https://github.com/Alfagun74/gamevault-steam-dupe-finder-plugin/releases/latest) and unzip it into your server's mounted `plugins` directory.
2. **Steam API Key:** Grab your personal Steam API Key [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
3. **Set Your SteamID64:** Find your SteamID64 [here](https://steamid.io) and save it in the environment variable `PLUGIN_ALFAGUN74_STEAM_DUPE_FINDER_USER_ID_64`.
4. **Configure API Key:** Set your Steam API Key in the environment variable `PLUGIN_ALFAGUN74_STEAM_DUPE_FINDER_API_KEY`.

You're ready to go!

## üéØ How It Works

The plugin checks your Steam library daily and compares it against the games stored in your vault. If matches are found, it logs them clearly in the application logs for review.

It smartly matches game names using Levenshtein distance to detect even closely named duplicates. For even greater accuracy, integrate IGDB ‚Äî it‚Äôll utilize Steam IDs directly from IGDB metadata.

This plugin only logs matches. It doesn't modify or tag your games.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage & Customization

- **Automatic Checks:** Enabled by default (runs every 24 hours). (An initial scan is triggered 1 minute after the server starts)
- **Disable Plugin:** Set `PLUGIN_ALFAGUN74_STEAM_DUPE_FINDER_INTERVAL` to `0`.
