## üéØ How It Works

The plugin automatically scans your Steam library and wishlist, comparing them to the games in your vault. If duplicates are detected, they are logged in the application logs for easy review.

### Enhanced Matching with IGDB

For improved accuracy, connect your GameVault Server to IGDB. This allows the plugin to use Steam IDs directly from IGDB metadata, providing:

- **Precise Matching:** Matches games based on Steam ID rather than name similarity.
- **Wishlist Checks:** Identifies games in your vault that are also on your Steam wishlist.

üìå **Note:** This plugin only logs matches‚Äîit does not modify or tag your games. Find relevant logs under the `SteamDupeFinderService` context.

### Running Without IGDB

- Without IGDB, the plugin relies on **Levenshtein distance** to identify closely named duplicates.
- **Wishlist matching is not supported** without IGDB.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage & Customization

- **Automatic Scans:** Runs every 24 hours by default.
- **Initial Scan:** A first-time scan runs 1 minute after the server starts.
- **Disable the Plugin:** Set `PLUGIN_ALFAGUN74_STEAM_DUPE_FINDER_INTERVAL` to `0`.
